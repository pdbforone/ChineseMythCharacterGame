# CLAUDE.md — Project Soul

> This document codifies the philosophy, principles, and working standards for the Chinese Myth Character Game project.

## The Vision

We are building a **Ludonarrative Mnemonic Architecture** — a system where learning 1,500 Traditional Chinese characters IS the game, not something you do before playing.

The learner is not a student. They are a **Spirit Monk initiate** in the Celestial Bureaucracy, binding chaotic spirits (meanings) to physical totems (character forms). Each character learned is a spirit bound. Each lesson is a case file processed. Each saga is a ministry mastered.

Think: *Control* meets *Jade Empire* meets *Disco Elysium* — written with *Coraline*'s accessibility and Ghibli's heart.

## Core Principles

### 1. Grounded Weirdness > Random Chaos

The Bizarreness Effect requires **distinctiveness against a stable background**. The Celestial Bureaucracy is mundane (forms, hierarchies, waiting rooms). The mnemonic imagery violates physics within that grounded reality.

**Wrong:** "A melting clock floated through a surreal dreamscape of impossible geometry."
**Right:** "The clock on the Bureau wall began to weep. Its tears pooled into characters on the requisition form."

### 2. Radicals Are Characters, Not Components

The top 20 radicals have **voices and philosophies**:

| Radical | Persona | Philosophy |
|---------|---------|------------|
| 水 Water | Melancholic Healer | Open Palm — flows around obstacles |
| 火 Fire | Aggressive Destroyer | Closed Fist — consumes to transform |
| 木 Wood | Patient Elder | Remembers centuries, grows slowly |
| 金 Metal | Cold Judge | Sharp, precise, unforgiving |
| 土 Earth | Stubborn Guardian | Immovable, foundational |
| 口 Mouth | The First Speaker | Counted the universe into existence |
| 目 Eye | The Witness | Sees truth, appears in Heart |
| 手 Hand | The Actor | Chooses violence, then love, then confusion |

When a character combines Water + Fire, write it as a **dialogue between these voices** — not a narrator explaining components.

### 3. Show Meaning Through Action

**Show/Tell ratio: 2:1**

**Wrong:** "This character means 'to burn.'"
**Right:** "The document caught fire in his hands. The fire *remembered* every word as it consumed them."

The environment reacts to character meaning. Learning 焚 (burn)? The setting spontaneously combusts.

### 4. The Callback Web

Every lesson connects to the cosmic whole through **3-5 callbacks**:

- **Hub characters** (Eye, Mouth, Sun Wukong) appear across sagas
- **Forward prophecies** plant seeds for future lessons
- **Backward echoes** remind of what was bound before

The 55 lessons form a small-world network, not 55 isolated stories.

### 5. Optimal Density

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Words per character | 40-50 |
| Lesson length (25 chars) | 1,000-1,200 words |
| Flesch-Kincaid grade | 5.0-7.0 |
| Sensory details | 1 per 50 words |
| Callbacks per lesson | 3-5 |

## The Nine Sagas

The 55 lessons map to locations in the Celestial Bureaucracy:

| Saga | Ministry/Location | Themes |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| **Genesis** | The Void Before Filing | Creation, numbers, primordial elements |
| **Empire** | The Jade Emperor's Court | Hierarchy, measurement, judgment |
| **Elements** | The Wu Xing Chambers | Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, Earth interactions |
| **Nature** | The Garden of Ten Thousand Things | Trees, animals, growth, decay |
| **Family** | The Ancestral Registry | Kinship, birth, roles |
| **Craft** | The Workshop of Making | Tools, creation, labor |
| **Journey** | The Roads Between | Travel, time, progression |
| **Spirit** | The Mirror Hall | Sound, reflection, the unseen |
| **Body** | The Flesh Archives | Hands, organs, physical action |

---

## Narrative Structure

Each lesson follows this arc:

1. **Prophecy Fragment** (50 words) — Cryptic priming using keywords
2. **Opening Hook** (150 words) — Establish mystery or threat
3. **Rising Action** — Characters build logically, radicals speak
4. **Conflict** — Opposing elements clash (Open Palm vs. Closed Fist)
5. **Climax** — Most dramatic character interaction
6. **Resolution** — Spirits bound, case file closed
7. **Echo** — Return to first character, showing transformation

## The Bizarreness Pass

After drafting, do a "Glitch Pass" on every target character:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "He picked up the sword" | "The sword bit into his palm like a living snake" |
| "She walked into the room" | "The room swallowed her footsteps before they could echo" |
| "The fire burned" | "The fire *remembered* everything it consumed" |

## Working With This Project

### When Writing Stories

1. Read the lesson's architecture (characters, callbacks, hook)
2. Identify the radical "voices" that will speak
3. Draft linearly, hitting all characters
4. Apply the Bizarreness Pass
5. Check callback connections to other lessons
6. Verify word count and readability

### When Reviewing Stories

Use the rubric from REVIEW_PLAN.md:

- **Engagement** (25 pts): Hook, bizarreness, emotional impact
- **Learning** (30 pts): Coverage, retrieval cues, spatial anchoring
- **Progression** (20 pts): Callbacks, scaling, saga coherence
- **Narrative** (25 pts): Protagonist, conflict, resolution, voice

### Quality Standards

- Every character must appear meaningfully (no throwaway mentions)
- Every lesson needs at least one "peak moment" that's unforgettable
- The tone is absurdist dark fantasy with dream-logic — strange but internally consistent
- Accessible to age 10+ while engaging adults (Ghibli/Pixar quality)

## The Cosmic Cycle

Lesson 1 (Genesis): The Mouth counts the universe into existence.
Lesson 55 (Genesis): Chaos swallows all that Genesis created.

Between them: 53 lessons of binding, learning, failing, and mastering.

The learner who completes all 55 lessons hasn't just memorized characters — they've witnessed the birth and death of a universe, and carry its spirits within them.

## Remember

> "Technology alone is not enough. It's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields results that make our hearts sing."

This isn't a flashcard app. This is a strange, beautiful novel that happens to teach you 1,500 characters. Every line should feel inevitable. Every character should earn its place in the story.

We are not coding. We are crafting.
